# Love Letter

### Project description
Preliminary project for the software development internship in the winter semester 2023-2024.
### About the game
The card game "Love Letter" by Japanese game designer Seiji Kanai. The object of this game is to send (as many as possible) love letters to a princess in order to seek her favor.
Different characters in the royal court strive to achieve this goal, with varying chances based on their status and abilities. The rules can be found in detail at following link:

## Task definition in the first part of the preliminary project
- The implementation will be limited to playing in the local console by means of game commands. After the start of the game, the players will switch in turn per round. They start their actions from the same console.
- Start the implementation of your game "Love Letter" by thinking about a data model for the game. What objects do you need? How do they interact with each other? You can create a UML class diagram for this purpose.
- Your current version of the game must meet the following requirements:
- Your program should ask for the desired number of players at the beginning (2-4 players).
- Then you should be able to assign names for each player.
- The game should be controlled directly from the console by special commands (use the escape character 'Backslash', which marks the game command).
- With \help all available commands shall be issued with a short explanation for your program. Don't forget to extend this command in the course of your implementation.
- Prepare the following commands as the basic framework of your game:
    - \start to start the game.
    - \playCard to play a card.
    - \showHand to show the hand of the current player.
    - \showScore to show the score for each player.
